The statement is True because:

git revert is safer than git reset in most cases, particularly in collaborative workflows, as it avoids rewriting history and does not risk losing work.

git revert	When you need to undo a commit without rewriting history (collaborative repositories).
git reset	When you want to completely undo changes locally and rewrite history (e.g., before pushing).
